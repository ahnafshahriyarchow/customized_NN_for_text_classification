# customized_NN_for_text_classification

We have a train dataset with 10,000 rows and test dataset with 3,000 rows. Train dataset has labels but test dataset has no label.
* We trained a customized neural network model
* Test your model on test data
* Marked the decision on the label column of test data. Initially, label colum is all empty. We filled that column with decision.
